playing around with SVGs

- SVGs are pretty neat. Next time will be to learn how to create one in either Illustrator or Inkscape
- Safari has this weird bug with inline SVGs fill transition if the SVG is inside a link. I found a neat solution in Stack overflow and combined them. Links: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22593883/why-doesnt-this-css-transition-work-on-svg-inside-an-anchor and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16846628/svg-css3-animation-not-working-with-link-markup
- Tested in: **Safari Version 9.1.1 (10601.6.17)**, **Chrome Version 50.0.2661.102 (64-bit)** and **Firefox Version 46.0.1**


###Time taken
Approximately 2-2.5 hours, including the time needed to google and fix the Safari bug thingy
